This repository is a collection of the IPython notebooks that I created and used for the introductory machine learning course that I taught online and which I teach now in colleges as a weekend course. Each lecture does not necessarily have an IPython notebook, so you might see some of the indices missing.

The contents of the repository are as follows:
1. **Lecture 1 - PandasIntro**: Quick introduction to the Pandas library. Covers importing files, indexing, slicing, plotting, boolean indexing and other prominently used techniques using Pandas.
2. **Lecture 2 - Linear Regression**: Implementing linear regression using sklearn and understanding the outputs of the model, understanding regression co-efficients and making predictions on new data.
3. **Lecture 2 - Polynomial Regression**: This notebook has been created with a specific focus of explaining overfitting and underfitting.
4. **Lecture 4 - Random Forest**: Intuitive explanation of decision trees and how ensemble methods can overcome the problem of overfitting. Sklearn implementation of Random Forest.
5. **Lecture 5 - k-means clustering**: Intuitive explanation and implementation of k-means clustering. Using PCA to form clusters for the popular MNIST dataset.
6. **Lecture 6 - PCA**: Understanding and implementing PCA in Python using sklearn. How dimensionality reduction works, how can we leverage PCA in understanding high dimensional data.
7. **Lecture 8 - Neural Network Basics**: Implementing feed-forward neural nets using Keras. MNIST dataset has been used for the purpose of illustration.
8. **Lecture 9 - Convolution Neural Nets (CNN)**: Implementing CNN's using Keras. MNIST dataset has been used for the purpose of illustration.
9. **Lecture 11 - Natural Language Processing**: Creating a sentiment classifier using bag-of-words model. The notebook takes through the process from data cleaning to vectorizing and eventually modeling. The IMDB dataset has been used for the purpose of illustration.
10. **Lecture 12 - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: This is in continuation to the sentiment classifier built in the previous notebook on NLP. It used RNN's to further enhance the performace on the IMDB dataset.
